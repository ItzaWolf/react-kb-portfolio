        <p>Passionate about the world of technology, I am on a determined journey to become a proficient full-stack developer.
             My background includes valuable experience as a consultant agent at Geek Squad, 
             where I assisted customers with their technical needs and honed my problem-solving skills. 
             Prior to that, I contributed to the tech industry by repairing Chromebooks in a warehouse, 
             where attention to detail and technical expertise were paramount.
             My journey involves mastering languages and frameworks like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, React.js, and Flask.
             With a strong foundation in guest relations and a dedicated work ethic,
             I am committed to enhancing efficiency and performance through conscientious and detail-oriented approaches.</p>
